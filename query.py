# Get all models that are older than 1960.

# Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded > 1920).all()

# Get all models with names that begin with "Cor".

# Get all brands with that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.

# Part 3: Discussion Questions (Include your answers as comments.)

# 1. What is the returned value and datatype of ``Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')``?
# It returns an object from brand class where the brand name is 'Ford', the returned value include object attributes of id, name, founded, headquarters and discontinued.

# 2. In your own words, what is an association table, and what *type* of relationship
# does an association table manage?
# association table manages many-to-many relationship, 
# where it adds many-to-a relationship to left table and a-to-many relationship to the right table. 
# It only has columns of primary keys from both tables.
